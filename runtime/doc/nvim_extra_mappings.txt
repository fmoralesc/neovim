EXTRA MAPPINGS FOR NVIM                                      *nvim-extra-mappings*

The `early/extra-mappings.vim` script provides a few keyboard mappings that might
be useful, and tries to fix some issues the community has identified with Vim's
default behavior.

This script is loaded before the |vimrc|, so the mappings below can be easily
overridden by the user.

The mappings provided are:

								*t_<Esc><Esc>*
1. <Esc><Esc> leaves terminal-mode (see |nvim-terminal-emulator|), like
   CTRL-\ CTRL-N (see |CTRL-\_CTRL-N|).

							     *undoable_CTRL-u*
2. <C-u> can be undone. (see |i_CTRL-U|)

								  *smart-home*
3. <Home> moves the cursor to the first non-blank character of the line on
   first press (like |^|), and the first character of the line on second (like
   |0|). It alternates afterwards.
